# 🧠 Bank Marketing Analysis with Decision Tree Classifier

This project involves analyzing the **Bank Marketing Dataset** using a **Decision Tree Classifier** implemented in Python on Google Colab. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various personal, contact, and campaign-related features.
